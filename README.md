#### What is this ReactJS Template?

Tired of creating a new ReactJS project from scratch? Even worse by using create-react-app? Well, this is the template for you! This template is a basic one using Babel, Webpack, React, React Dom, React Router Dom, SCSS, etc. I don't provide custom things, just a base template to replace create react app and to help react developers to use the latest packages.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Git
> Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for your system.
> Check that git is correctly installed by opening a Terminal and doing `git -v`.
- NodeJS
> Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (I recommend using [Node Version Manager (Linux)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Node Version Manager (Windows)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)).
> Check that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) & [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are correctly installed by opening a Terminal and doing `node -v` and `npm -v`.

### How to use

#### 1. Clone the repository
##### Command Line
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TheNolle/ReactJS-Template
# Enter the cloned repository
cd ReactJS-Template
```

#### 2. Install the required dependencies (Command Line Only)
1. Open a terminal in the cloned repository
2. Run the command `npm -v` to make sure [NodeJS] works there
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies

#### 3. Run the Application with your modifications
In the same terminal run this: `npm run start` and enjoy. ðŸŽ‰
